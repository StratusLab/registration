      The StratusLab reference cloud infrastructures are a technology preview
      giving users the opportunity to try out the StratusLab cloud distribution
      and providing the project feedback on its use and operation.

    <h2>Limited Guarantees</h2>

    <p>
      The StratusLab reference cloud infrastructures are operated on a best-effort

      reliability, and availability.

      <strong>  
      The project does not accept liability for 
      any damages resulting from the unavailability of the services or from data 
      loss.
      </strong>
